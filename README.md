# PaintHack

Directions:
1. Open Paint (do not open an image)(We need the window title Untitled).
2. Adjust the size of the drawing area to 400x400 pixels.
3. Start the program
4. The program waits until Paint has focus for the first time.

If the base pointer and the offsets are incorrect in the future:
Use the cheat engine to find the address of the first pixel like in all other games.
But the first pixel is not the top left one.
